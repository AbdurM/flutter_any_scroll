# Any Scroll

A Flutter widget that lets you scroll both horizontally and vertically. Originally written for my personal project, trying to contribute a little to the great flutter community.

## Example

TODO: List prerequisites and provide or point to information on how to
start using the package.

## Usage

AnyScroll(
    mainAxisCount: 5,
    crossAxisCount: 5,
    crossAxisSpacing: 5,
    header: const CategoriesHeader(),
    children: categoryCells,
);

## Additional information

TODO: Tell users more about the package: where to find more information, how to 
contribute to the package, how to file issues, what response they can expect 
from the package authors, and more.
